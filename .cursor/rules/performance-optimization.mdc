- Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
- Optimize State Management: Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed.
- Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
- Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
- Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.
- Memoization: Use React.memo() for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- FlatList Optimization: Optimize FlatList with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize.
- Avoid Anonymous Functions: Refrain from using anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.
